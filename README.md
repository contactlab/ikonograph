# Ikonograph

Ikonograph is the official Contactlab icons library. You can use it as npm/bower dependency, you have just to import the css file and you can start to add icons everywhere


## Installation

### Required tools
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Bower](https://bower.io/) (```$ npm install -g bower```)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) (```$ npm install -g gulp-cli``` and ```npm install --save-dev gulp```) (only for development)

### Quick use

Download .zip package or install the Bower module 

```
$ bower install ikonograph
```

Link the `css` file from your dependencies inside the page:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/ikonograph/dist/ikonograph.min.css">
```

Add the `clab-icon` css root class to your element and add the icon-related css class to display the relative icon:

```html
<span class="clab-icon icon-[name]"></span>
```
